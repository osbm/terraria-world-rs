## Summary

This is a rust library for reading, manipulating, and writing Terraria world files. It may not be efficient because its actually my first rust project.


My goals for this project are to:
- Have fun
- Learn rust
- Contribute something to the community
- [ ] Make a WASM website that can tell you about your world's corruption.
- [ ] Procedurally generate worlds, like maze world where you have to navigate through a labyrinth of blocks.
- [ ] Being able to change everything about a world, and get information about it. Like tiles, chests, signs, and more.


## Usage

Just run this command to add the crate to your project:

```bash
cargo add terraria-world
```

More examples will be written by me and will be added here.

## Credits

I would like to thank the [Stefano Pigozzi](https://github.com/Steffo99) for his [lihzahrd](https://github.com/Steffo99/lihzahrd) project. I basically ported his entire codebase to rust. And honestly his code is still way better than mine.
